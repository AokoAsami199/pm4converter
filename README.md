# pm4converter
This script tries to convert pm3 plugins to pm4 as good as possible, but sadly not perfect.
Please open issues if you find any unexpected behaviour, to help improving this script.

## How to use
Download and run this script. The first parameter you specify will be the path to the plugin folder you want to convert (make sure to enter the path to the folder `plugin.yml` and `src` are in!)
The script will generate a folder `output/<plugin_name>` with the converted plugin. The old one will remain unchanged.
